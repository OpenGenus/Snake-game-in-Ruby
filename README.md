Snake game in Ruby
This is a traditional snake game made using ruby and the ruby2d gem.
1. Start the game by going to the folder where the game file is stored and running `ruby snake.rb` in your terminal.
2. You then control the snake  with the directional arrows on your keyboard and eat as much food as you can without colliding with your own tail.
